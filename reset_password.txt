1. Boot from the Live CD/USB. Insert your Live CD or USB stick. Reboot the computer and choose to boot from the CD/USB from the BIOS or UEFI boot menu.

2. Open a Terminal. Once the live environment is loaded, locate and open a terminal window.

3. Identify the System’s Root Partition. You can use tools like fdisk or lsblk to identify your system’s root partition.
sudo fdisk -l
# or
sudo lsblk -f

Look for partitions that are likely Linux root partitions, such as ext4, xfs, etc.

4. Mount the Root Partition. Create a mount point by running this command:
sudo mkdir /mnt/myroot

Mount the identified root partition (replace /dev/sdXY with your partition, for example, /dev/sda1):
sudo mount /dev/sdXY /mnt/myroot

5. Change Root into the System. Use chroot to change the root directory by using this command:
sudo chroot /mnt/myroot

6. Reset the Password. Now that you’ve chrooted into your system, you can use the passwd command to change the password for any user, including root.
passwd username

Replace “username” with the actual username or use root to reset the root password.

7. Exit and Unmount. Exit the chroot environment and unmount the partition.
exit
sudo umount /mnt/myroot

8. Reboot. Remove the Live CD/USB and reboot your computer. Now, you should now be able to log in using the new password.

That’s it! You’re now able to reset passwords in Linux. To reset passwords, you can use either the GRUB method or a Live CD. The GRUB method is fast and doesn’t need external tools, but a Live CD is more universal and works well for complex system setups or restricted GRUB access.
